# Homework 3

In this assignment you are to create a Vue.js application that allows a User to:

 - Fetch all available categories and dynamically display them.
 - Fetch a random Chuck Norris fact from _any_ category, including _all_.
 - Search Chuck Norris facts and return all facts that match the search query.
 - See a history of all search queries that were submitted for the given session.
	- NOTE: You do not need to persist the history if the User closes their browser or navigates away from your site.

Your page should dynamically update to display a single fact or a list of search results.  Search results and random facts should never be shown simultaneously.
